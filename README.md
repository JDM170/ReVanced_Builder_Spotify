# ReVanced builder

Build ReVanced package (.apk) easily than ever using latest ReVanced patches and dependencies locally or via cloud

## Usage

### Locally

* To build `revanced.apk` locally you need just to run [`Build.ps1`](https://github.com/JDM170/ReVanced_Builder/blob/main/Build.ps1) via PowerShell;
* All [patches](https://revanced.app/patches?pkg=com.google.android.youtube) except the followings applied to `revanced.apk`:
  * always-autorepeat
  * hide-captions-button
  * hide-timestamp
  * hide-seekbar
* The script downloads latest available YouTube package (having parsed [ReVanced API](https://api.revanced.app/v4/patches/list)) supported by ReVanced Team from [APKMirror](https://apkmirror.com) and all dependencies and build package using [Zulu JDK](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk);
* Script installs no apps â€” everything will be held in your `Script location folder\ReVanced`;
* After compiling you get `revanced.apk` & `microg.apk` ready to be installed;
* Release notes are generated dynamically using the [ReleaseNotesTemplate.md](https://github.com/JDM170/ReVanced_Builder/blob/main/ReleaseNotesTemplate.md) template.

### By using CI/CD

Trigger the [`Build`](https://github.com/JDM170/ReVanced_Builder/actions/workflows/Build.yml) action manually to create [release page](https://github.com/JDM170/ReVanced_Builder/releases/latest) with configured release notes showing dependencies used for building.

`ReVanced.zip` will contain a built `revanced.apk` & latest `microg.apk`.

## Requirements if you compile locally

* Windows 10 x64 or Windows 11
* Windows PowerShell 5.1
  * if you want to use PowerShell 7, you will have to install a 3rd party HTML parser ([AngleSharp](https://github.com/AngleSharp/AngleSharp))
